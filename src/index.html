            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
                Waggerz was founded by a group of professional groomers who were tired of the big box ethos of “sell more, do less”.  With over 45 years of animal handling and training experience, we will always put your pet first.  We are dedicated to not only providing exceptional service to you and your pet, but also to our planet.  We use only all natural, eco friendly shampoos, conditioners, sprays and even our cleaning products are green!

                What We Do
            </h3>
            <p>
                Every pet we see is treated as a member of our family.  From simple bath and nail trim to a full groom we believe every pet is special and deserves to be treated that way!  Even those with special behavioral or medical needs are welcome at Waggerz.  Our staff is highly trained to handle even the most delicate of babies!  Our staff is trained in Pet CPR and First Aid!

        <h4>Matting Policy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Matting policy: We don’t like to pull, tug & hurt pets in order to get rid of mats. If a pet is extremely matted, we shave him/her. Shaving a matted coat includes risks of nicks, cuts, or abrasions. Matting can also trap moisture near your pet’s skin allowing bacteria to grow revealing irritations to skin prior to grooming. After effects of mat removal can include itchiness, skin redness, self-inflicted irritations/abrasions, and or brief behavioral changes. Any of these potential conditions will be treated by owner at their own expense.
            </li>
            <li>
                We will also charge an additional matting fee depending on the condition because it requires more time & care. ( De-mat Fee is $30.00 Per Hour)
